## Our Goal

Bias Cards is an educational tool designed to help researchers and practitioners identify, understand, and mitigate various forms of bias throughout a project's lifecycle. Specifically, we hope to make bias awareness and mitigation strategies accessible to everyone working with AI and machine learning systems.

This project is part of the [Turing Commons](https://ala-turing-institute.github.io/turing-commons) initiative‚Äîa strategic skills project at the Alan Turing Institute. The Turing Commons provides free and open-source educational resources to help bridge the gap between technical AI development and ethical considerations.

## How It Works

### üóÇÔ∏è Bias Card Library

Bias Cards provides a comprehensive library of biases, categorised into three main types:

1. **Cognitive Biases**: biases that affect the judgment and decision-making of members of a research or development project
2. **Social Biases**: biases arising from societal structures and historical inequities that can be amplified by data-driven technologies
3. **Statistical Biases**: formal biases in data and modelling techniques

Each card in our library includes:

- **Clear descriptions** with real-world context
- **Practical examples** showing how the bias manifests
- **Reflection prompts** to help identify the bias in your work

### üîÑ Project Lifecycle Model

Our tool maps biases to specific stages of a project's lifecycle. Each project will, invariably, have a different set of stages and composition. Therefore, the project lifecycle model we provide can be treated as a heuristic model to structure reflection and deliberation, rather than a prescriptive model for governing a project or organisation.

### üß© Structured Activity and Report generation

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve and expand the Bias Cards library. Whether you're a researcher, practitioner, or educator, your insights can help make AI development more responsible and inclusive.

### Ways to Contribute

- **Submit new bias examples** from your field experience
- **Improve card descriptions** for clarity and accessibility
- **Suggest mitigation strategies** that have worked in practice
- **Report issues** or bugs you encounter
- **Share feedback** on how we can improve the tool

All contributions are managed through our GitHub repository:
