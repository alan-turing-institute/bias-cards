## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the [Dashboard](/dashboard)
2. Click **"New Activity"**
3. Fill in the basic information:

- Title of your assessment (e.g. project title)
- Description (i.e. additional information about the project)
- Domain/Sector

## Using the Workspace: completing the 5-stage activity

The activity workspace is where you'll spend most of your time in Bias Cards. It's an interactive environment where you can map biases to your specific project's lifecycle stages, add notes, and build a comprehensive bias assessment.

The activity consists of five stages:

1. Preliminary risk assessment
2. Lifecycle assignment
3. Documentation of rationale
4. Selecting bias mitigation techniques
5. Implementation planning

This tutorial will walk you through each of these stages, explaining what is involved.

<Callout type="warning">
  The Workspace uses drag-and-drop functionality. Make sure you're using a
  modern browser for the best experience.

### Stage 1: Preliminary risk assessment

In this first stage, you'll categorise bias cards based on their potential impact on your project. Think carefully about your specific contextâ€”a bias that's high-risk for an emergency department AI might be low-risk for a different application.

      caption:
        'Stage 1 begins with an empty workspace showing four risk categories. The progress bar indicates you need to categorise at least 10 bias cards to proceed. Each category has a distinct colour and description to guide your assessment.',

    },
  ]}
/>

### Stage 2: Lifecycle assignment

Now you'll map your categorised biases to specific stages in the ML project lifecycle. This helps identify when biases are most likely to emerge and affect your system.

    {
      id: 1,

      caption:
        "Stage 2 presents the ML project lifecycle divided into phases. Your goal is to map categorised biases to specific lifecycle stages where they're most likely to emerge, creating a comprehensive view of bias risks throughout your project.",
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      title: 'Categorised Bias Library',

      caption:
        'Access your previously categorised biases from the side panel. Cards maintain their risk-level colour coding, helping you prioritise high-risk biases when mapping them to lifecycle stages.',

      caption:
        'Multiple biases can affect the same lifecycle stage, reflecting the complex nature of bias in ML projects. The progress indicator helps track your mapping completion whilst encouraging thorough consideration.',
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      title: 'Project Lifecycle Stages',
      image: '/tutorial/stage2/04-project-lifecycle-stages.png',
      caption:
        'The complete lifecycle view spans from project design through system deployment. This comprehensive mapping ensures you consider bias risks throughout the entire ML project journey, not just during development.',
    },
    {

      caption:
        'Click any bias card to explore detailed information, including practical examples and discussion prompts. This deeper understanding helps inform your mapping decisions and prepares you for mitigation planning.',
    },
  ]}
/>

### Stage 3: Documentation of rationale

Document your reasoning for each bias assessment and mapping. This creates an audit trail and helps team members understand your decision-making process.

<Stage3Carousel />

### Stage 4: Selecting bias mitigation techniques

Choose appropriate mitigation strategies for each identified bias. Focus on high-risk biases first and consider resource constraints when selecting techniques.

<Stage4Carousel />

### Stage 5: Implementation planning

Transform your mitigation strategies into an actionable implementation plan with clear timelines, responsibilities, and success metrics.

<Stage5Carousel />

<Callout type="tip">

**Creating an effective plan:**

- Set realistic timelines based on available resources
- Assign clear ownership for each mitigation strategy
- Define measurable success criteria
- Build in regular review points to assess progress
- Consider phased implementation for complex strategies

## Next Steps

Now that you know how to use the workspace to carry out the bias assessment activity, learn how to generate professional documentation.
