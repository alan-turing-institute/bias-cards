## Why Generate Reports?

Reports transform your interactive bias assessment into shareable, professional documentation. They serve multiple purposes:

- **Documentation** - Formal record of bias considerations
- **Compliance** - Evidence of responsible AI practices
- **Communication** - Share findings with stakeholders
- **Audit Trail** - Track decisions and changes over time
- **Knowledge Sharing** - Help others learn from your experience

<Callout type="info">
  Reports can be generated at any point in your project, not just at the end. Regular reporting helps track progress and changes.
