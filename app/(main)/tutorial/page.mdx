  This tutorial is organised into several sections. You can follow them in order
  or jump to the topics most relevant to your needs.
</Callout>

## What You'll Learn

By completing this tutorial, you will:

- gain an understanding of the three bias categories: social, statistical, and cognitive;
- learn how to navigate the bias library effectively;
- explore how to complete the bias identification and evaluation activity, which will have you mapping biases to project lifecycle stages; and
- learn how to generate professional reports for documentation and to help you implement bias mitigation techniques in your project.

## Prerequisites

No special technical knowledge is required to use the Bias Cards app. However, you'll get the most value if you have:

- a basic understanding of machine learning and artificial intelligence concepts;
- a specific ML project in mind to assess; and
- a general understanding of cognitive, statistical, and social biases.

## Who is this app for?

### For Researchers

The Bias Cards app can help you with:

- Comprehensive bias categorisation
- Literature connections to topics in bias descriptions
- Report generation to support publications

### For Practitioners

The Bias Cards app can help you:

- Identify practical mitigation strategies
- Evaluate the impact of possible biases in a project or system
- Conduct team reflection and deliberation workshops

### For Educators

The Bias Cards app can help you:

- Design activity templates for teaching
- Create structured case studies for students
- Set report generation for assignments
