  "description": "Data augmentation expands training datasets through systematic modifications and synthetic data generation to address sparsity and imbalances. Techniques include rotation, cropping, and noise addition for images, paraphrasing for text, and generative models for creating synthetic samples. This approach helps models generalise better and reduces bias towards overrepresented groups by balancing dataset composition.",

    "What specific gaps in your dataset need to be addressed through augmentation?",

  ],
  "example": "A medical AI for detecting skin cancer shows poor performance on darker skin tones due to limited training examples. The team uses data augmentation to generate synthetic images by adjusting lighting, contrast, and skin tone variations of existing lesion images. They validate the augmented data with dermatologists to ensure medical accuracy, significantly improving diagnostic performance across all skin types.",
