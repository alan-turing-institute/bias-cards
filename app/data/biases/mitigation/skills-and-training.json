  "description": "Skills and training programmes build team capabilities in recognising, measuring, and mitigating AI bias. Training covers topics like fairness metrics, inclusive design principles, bias testing methodologies, and ethical decision-making. Regular upskilling ensures teams stay current with evolving best practices and can effectively implement bias mitigation strategies throughout the AI lifecycle.",

  "example": "An AI development team undergoes quarterly bias training covering unconscious bias recognition, fairness metric interpretation, and inclusive user research methods. Training includes hands-on workshops where team members practice identifying bias in real datasets. Post-training assessments show improved detection of representation gaps and more consistent application of fairness evaluation techniques across projects.",
