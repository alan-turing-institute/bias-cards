  "description": "Regular auditing establishes systematic, ongoing review processes to monitor AI systems for emerging biases and performance drift. Audits examine data quality, model behaviour, user satisfaction, and equitable outcomes across different demographic groups. This proactive approach enables early detection of bias issues and ensures continuous improvement of fairness throughout the system lifecycle.",

    "How frequently should comprehensive bias audits be conducted based on your system's risk level?",
