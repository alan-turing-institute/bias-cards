  "description": "External validation tests model performance and fairness using independent datasets from different populations, time periods, or geographical regions. This approach reveals biases that internal validation might miss, particularly those related to distribution shift and overfitting to specific populations. Collaborating with external organisations provides fresh perspectives and validates generalisability across diverse real-world conditions.",

  "example": "A medical diagnostic AI developed in London hospitals shows excellent performance internally but struggles when tested on patient data from rural clinics and international hospitals. External validation reveals the model overfitted to urban demographics and specific equipment types. This prompts data collection partnerships with diverse healthcare settings to improve model robustness.",
